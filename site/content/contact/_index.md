Greg Kallfa  -  Owner, Engineer, Brewer

In late 2013 I co-founded Boulder Colorado's only homebrew store Boulder Fermentation Supply, and later in 2015 Vision Quest Brewery.   

Boulder Fermentation Supply is a retail shop for every type of fermentation.  While the majority of our business is brewing, we also stock supplies for wine, cider, mead, sake, distilled spirits, kombucha, jun, cheese, fermented veggies, and more.   We rent out wine and apple processing equipment.  We hold classes for many of the fermentations we support.


Vision Quest Brewery has primarily operated as a tasting room for the 25+ beverages we make here.   To be a brewery in a saturated market such as Colorado you need to stand out and make some incredible brews.  We brew every style under the sun, from the ever popular hazy IPAs, fruity sours, barrel aged Belgian beers, kombucha, jun, seltzer, and use cutting edge yeasts such as Kveik, Lachancea, and more.   In the beginning of 2020 we purchased our first canning line.  We are slowly expanding our can sales into greater Colorado.  


In 2015, when Vision Quest first opened, I realized we would need some way to wash kegs.   I had already been tinkering in various electrical engineering projects and dove head first into the world of keg washing.   Within a year I had the earliest prototype, which was made using motorized ball valves.   Finally around 2017 I had built a keg washer out of the industry standard pneumatic valves, which are good for hundreds of thousands of cycles.   It became a side business to wash other breweries kegs in Boulder.  Since keg washers have always been a sizeable investment, many smaller breweries would have a larger brewery wash their kegs.   At the time of writing this, I have personally washed over 15,000 kegs at Vision Quest.    I have gained extensive knowledge about the keg washing process over these years and I personally handle every aspect of these keg washing machines.
