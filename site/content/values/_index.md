      This customer wanted to wash upwards of 40 kegs per hour.  For this the triple head, with liquid sensor and pressure sensor was recommended.  The customer also wanted to use an external sanitizer tank, you can see there are 2 pumps on this washer but only one 30 gallon detergent tank.

      Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known
      geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a
      specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of
      the coffee is then usuall the place it was grown to whatever
      degree available.

      This model was made for a customer who wanted an acid/sani tank in addition to the standard caustic/detergent tank.  The thermometer is the only required sensor for all machines.  In addition, this model features a liquid sensor to move to the next step the moment the kegs are clear.  Level switches are installed in both chemical tanks for dry fire protection and auto filling each tank.   An adjustable pressure switch is used to consistently charge the kegs with CO2.  The tanks on this washer are rectangular with a total volume of 25 gallons.

       This model is a very popular style because the sanitizer is not
    recycled using an extra tank.  Instead it is injected into the
    rinse water making this model cheaper than the recycling versions.
    This gives a more accurate dosage of sanitizer since it is always
    fresh.

      This is a photo of the prototype keg washer that started Omniwasher
    Keg Washers.  This is the keg washer used at Vision Quest brewery,
    over 20,000 kegs have been washed with this model.  We use this washer
    to test new features.  This washer works as good as the day it was
    built and is a testament to the smart design and engineering that
    went into making it.
