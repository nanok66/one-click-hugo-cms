blurb:
    heading: The most flexible keg washer on the market
    text: "OmniWasher keg washers are professional, feature rich, and customizeable, making them the most flexible keg washers on the market.   Customers are allowed to choose the build that suits their specific needs.   Multiple washing cycles including pulse rinse cycles for maximum cleaning.   Custom cycles are also available.   In addition to washing kegs, users are able to control each device independently, giving this keg washer additional uses besides keg cleaning.   Most common additional uses are heating CIP solutions (kettles are often excessively large for this task)  and filling kegs with warm draft line cleaning solutions.   Thousands cheaper than comparable keg washers on the market.  Low cost is possible because the entire machine from welding to wiring is made by the owner, Greg Kallfa.  100% made in Colorado, USA. "

    heading: Our values
    text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
